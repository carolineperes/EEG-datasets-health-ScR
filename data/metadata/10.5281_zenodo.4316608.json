[AD: i108,\u00a0MCI: i100,\u00a0SCD: i090,\u00a0HC: s055] \u00a0 Participants & Settings In total 230\u00a0participants have been recruited from the memory and dementia clinic of the Greek Association of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders (GAADRD) and the 1st Department of Neurology, U.H. AHEPA, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. The full dataset includes: Healthy Controls Elders (60+ years old): 33 participants Subjective Cognitive Decline: 34\u00a0participants Mild Cognitive Impairment: 79\u00a0participants Alzheimer's Disease: 48\u00a0participants Healthy Young (25-40 years old): 36\u00a0participants The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval by the Scientific and Ethics Committee of GAADRD (No56_27/11/2016), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their participation in the study. The diagnosis of AD was conducted by a neuropsychiatrist according to their medical history, neuropsychological performance, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical and neurological examinations. Participants with AD fulfilled the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable AD, as well as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type (American Psychological Association, 1994). On the other hand, the MCI participants fulfilled the Petersen criteria, while the SCD group met International Working Group-2 guidelines\u00a0and the recent National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer\u2019s Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (NI-AA), as well as the SCD-I Working Group instructions.\u00a0 Resting-State EEG Recording Fifteen-minute resting EEG activity was recorded for all the participants. For the whole duration of the resting state EEG recording, participants were advised to keep themselves relaxed as much as possible, close their eyes and open them after the researcher\u2019s demand, sit still, minimize blinking or mouth movements and let their mind wander. The experimental procedure was monitored by a research assistant aiming to identify cases of horizontal eye movements, continued blinking, or excessive movement by visually inspecting the EEG traces during the experiment. More specifically, an EEG was registered for both resting conditions (eyes open, EO and eyes closed, EC) for at least 2\u20133 min for each period. EEG Data Acquisition The EEG data were collected by using the EGI 300 Geodesic EEG system (GES 300, CERTH-ITI, Thessaloniki, Greece) with a 256-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN) and a sampling rate of 250 Hz (EGI Eugene, OR). Moreover, the researcher placed the electrodes in accordance with the 256 HCGSN adult 1.0 montage system, while the signals were recorded relative to a vertex reference electrode (Cz), with AFz as the ground electrode with the electrodes\u2019 impedance below 50 k\u03a9 throughout the experimental procedure, as recommended for the high-input impedance amplifier.
